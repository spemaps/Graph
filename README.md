Notes for future improvement 14/7/2015

-change ids in html to match node attribute names in js. Allow for efficiency when updating.
-much of the update code exists to control the showing/hiding of elements in the update box. Something broke that no longer allows for showing/hiding. This code is obsolete and taking up space. We should delete it (save it in another version) or fix it, and I favor deleting it.
